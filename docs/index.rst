PrincetonLIPS Computing 
=======================

This site contains a number of useful resources for using Princeton research computing systems, our internal 
lab hosts (LIPS Private Compute or LPC), and generic Python utilities that seem to be re-implemented across many 
research projects. 
In addition, we provide a number of tutorials that cover common challenges in research.
